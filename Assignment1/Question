You work as a Devops Engineer in a leading Software Company. You have been
asked to Dockerize the applications on the production server. The company uses
custom software, therefore there is no pre-built container which can be used.

Assume the following things:
1. Assume the software to be installed is apache
2. Use an Ubuntu container

The company wants the following things:
1. Push a container to DockerHub with the above config
2. The Developers will not be working with Docker, hence from their side you will
just get the code. Write a Dockerfile which could put the code in the custom image
that you have built
